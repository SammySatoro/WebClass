                            Keep healthy food readily available. When you get hungry, you're more likely to eat the first thing you see on the counter or in the cupboard. Keep healthy food in easily accessible and visible places in your home and workplace. Put some fruits in a basket and place it on the kitchen counter.

At Shinji by Restaurant, it sets the stage for Master Chef and his team to demonstrate an artistry that dates back thousands of years.

At Greatist, we think this stardom is well earned: We consider the stuff a superfood thanks to its high protein and probiotic content.
